# Machine Learning with Python [WiP]

This repository builds a learning path to Data Science and Machine Learning. It primarily focusses on the below tasks which forms the base of any Data Science and Machine Learning project.
- Gathering or Extracting the data
- Exploring the Data, popularly called Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preparation
- Data Visualizations
- Model building, Training, Evaluation, Tuning and Outcome

## Project Contents

A prior knowledge of Python as programming language is expected to proceed with this learning. 
If not, then visit
- [MyPythonRepo](https://github.com/THEbombCoC/PythonAtWork)
- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Since this is a learning phase for me in Data Science, all the contents are build with **Concepts**, **Examples** and **Problem Solving Exercises**.
The contents touched upon are:
- NumPy, for Numerical Computation and Analysis
- Pandas, for Data extraction and Preparation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn, for Data Visualizations

### Install

We require **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

We will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

The jupyter notebook files can be run in the below loosely order.
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the package specific project directory (say: NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib...) `and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook <file_name>.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook <file_name>.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

Multiple datasets are involved in implementing the different facets of Data Science and ML.
All the required datasets are available at [Data Repository](https://github.com/THEbombCoC/DataScienceAtWork/tree/master/data).

##### Notification
```
This is a Work in Progress. It's expected to be completed by 2020.
Stay tuned for improvements and collaboration.
```
